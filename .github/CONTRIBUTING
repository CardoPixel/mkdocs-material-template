## Welcome and thank you

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MkDocs-material-template. It's people like you that make this project a valuable resource for everyone.

### Why your contributions matter

### What contributions do we look for?

We welcome contributions of all types including documentation updates, bug fixes, and feature additions. We particularly appreciate efforts to enhance accessibility and improve usability.

### Contributions we cannot accept

Please, do not use the issue tracker for support questions. Check whether the documentation and previously closed issues can help with your issue. For more general queries, Stack Overflow or similar forums might be more suitable.

## Ground Rules

### Expectations for conduct

* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to MkDocs-material-template? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

### Starting point for newcomers

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Getting started

### How to submit a contribution

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### Process for small or "obvious" fixes

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors can be submitted directly as a patch, without a CLA, as they do not introduce new functionality.

## How to report a bug

### Security disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email <cardo.pixelado@gmail.com> instead.

### Filing a bug report

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of the project are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### Philosophy and goals for development

The goal of this project is to provide an easily customizable, user-friendly platform for documentation with a focus on aesthetics and simplicity.

### Suggesting a feature

Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process

### After submission

The core team looks at Pull Requests regularly. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

You can chat with the core team and other community members on Github Discussions (Soonâ„¢).
